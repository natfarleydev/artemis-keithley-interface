# Readme for Keithley 2410 Controller

This build (2012-11-22) has been built with gtkmm 2.22 and the GPIB32 (both 32-bit libraries). Visual C++ 2010 Express was the IDE used for this. If using a new IDE, remember to change the vsprops to fit the new IDE. It might be worth making a new project file altogether. Plans in the future could include a 64-bit build, but for the year 4 project this is designed for, it's not needed right now.

This program is for the Kiethley 2410 and will soon support pulse operation.
